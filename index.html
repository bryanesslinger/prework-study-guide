          <li>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.</li>
          <li>CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The period preceding a CSS element designates it as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.</li>
           <li>JavaScript programs the behavior of web pages.</li> 
           <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
           <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
           <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
           <li>In Javascript, conditional statements and loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
           <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
           <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
           <li>A function is a reusable block of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
           <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
